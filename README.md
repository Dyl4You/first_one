# Golf Score Recorder

This simple command-line app lets you track a 9-hole round of golf by typing your score for each hole. It simulates dictation by accepting words like `birdie`, `par`, or `bogey` and converts them to strokes automatically.

## Running

```bash
python3 golf_app.py
```

For each hole, enter either a number of strokes or one of the recognized golf terms:

```
albatross, eagle, birdie, par, bogey, double bogey, triple bogey
```

After all 9 holes are entered, the program prints a scorecard and your total relative to par.
